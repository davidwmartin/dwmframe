# dwmframe
Basic CSS framework used for [edG Design](http://edgdesign.co) and my personal projects. 

## TODO 
1. Code audit, specific attention to consistency in variable naming
2. Annotate throughout
3. Strategy for importing directly from local project's scss manifest, to allow overrides of specific framework files.
